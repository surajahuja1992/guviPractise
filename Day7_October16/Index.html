                    architecture, you can create refreshing and gngaging visuals such as animations or beautiful photography, that act as a continumm,
                    ultimately inspiring users to scroll further down the page

                    Long-scrolling lends itself well to a narrative scrolling

                    now less about clicking and more about scrolling,swiping and tapping.
                    Long-scrolling websites take away the barrier of complex navigation,
                    providing a responsive,user-friendly experience for mobile users.

                        they are not so SEO friendly.Why? When you limit the number of pages on your website,Google has fewer pages to index and
                        negatively impacts your standing

                <p class="para-content-dark para8">50% of websites use bounce off the page if it hasnt loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the 
                    more high resolution imagery and animations you include, the longer it takes to load the page. When writing this artice, we tested somepopular parallax websites,and found that one with complexvisuals took upto 
                    30 seconds to load on a mobile device,whereas simple long-scrolling websites loaded within a few seconds

                    refer back to a certain element. An easy way around this is
